# SWOT analysis of renaming Perl 6 to Raku

## Strengths

- no longer linked to bad reputation of "Perl"
- frees up higher versioning of "Perl"
- removes source of Perl community stress
- is a cool name that should appeal to younger people
- name should better appeal to non-english native speakers
- should be easier to get distinctive TIOBE rating

## Weaknesses

- will *still* be linked to "Perl" because of historical connection
- may be hard to find using search engines, at least initially
- must start with TIOBE rating from scratch

## Opportunities

- could be considered a brand new language, and thus more interesting to some
- should re-invigorate development
- should re-invigorate marketing
- with better branding, should be able to get easier sponsorships / grants
- may get core developers who have left, back into the core team
- could be marketed as a programming language without corporate backing, and thus free from corporate influencing / agenda
- could be marketed as the 100-year language properly

## Threats

- may lose current users because of name change
- may lose current core developers because of name change
- may be made fun of as the language that cannot make up its mind
- may cause incompatibities / breakage that will reflect badly on overall image
- may not get enough traction to grow anyway

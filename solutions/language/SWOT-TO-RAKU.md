# SWOT analysis of renaming Perl 6 to Raku

## Strengths

- removes the confusion that Perl 6 is Perl version 6 (a new version of Perl).
- frees up higher versioning of "Perl"
- no longer linked to bad reputation of "Perl"
- removes source of Perl community stress
- is a cool name that should appeal to younger people
- name should better appeal to non-english native speakers
- should be easier to get distinctive TIOBE rating

## Weaknesses

- will *still* be linked to "Perl" because of historical connection
- Perl 6 books will not know of name change, and thus continue to "squat"
- Perl 6 blog posts will not know of name change, and thus continue to "squat"
- may be hard to find using search engines, at least initially
- must start with TIOBE rating from scratch
- in social media, #raku as a tag is overloaded with Japanese pottery meaning

## Opportunities

- could be considered a brand new language, and thus more interesting to some
- should re-invigorate development
- should re-invigorate marketing
- with better branding, should be able to get easier sponsorships / grants
- may get core developers who have left, back into the core team
- could be marketed as a programming language without corporate backing, and thus free from corporate influencing / agenda
- could be marketed on its own, with its own strengths, such as multi-paradigmity and concurrency, as well as coverage of the Unicode standard
- could be marketed as the 100-year language properly
- current Perl 6 books could be updated while changing the name
- current Perl 6 blog posts could be better marked with TIOBE tag (as they presently are not tagged correctly in general)
- reworked documentation could have *all* pages properly TIOBE tagged
- in social media, use new, distinctive #rakulang tag

## Threats

- may lose current users because of name change
- may lose current core developers because of name change
- may lose current book writers because of name change
- may be made fun of as the language that cannot make up its mind
- may cause incompatibities / breakage that will reflect badly on overall image
- may not get enough traction to grow anyway
